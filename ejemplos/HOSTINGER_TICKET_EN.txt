Subject: Need help editing footer in Twenty Twenty-Five theme on carmenalvarado.es

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Hello Hostinger Support Team,

I urgently need help with my website carmenalvarado.es. I'm trying to customize the footer but the changes are not being applied.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔴 PROBLEM:

The footer on my site shows 4 sections:
1. "Carmen Alvarado" (want to keep)
2. "Acerca de" / About (want to hide)
3. "Privacidad" / Privacy (want to hide)
4. "Social" (want to hide)

I need the footer to show ONLY "Carmen Alvarado" and "Cuidadora Profesional en Tarragona" centered.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ WHAT I'VE TRIED (without success):

1. Added custom CSS to the theme
2. Used WordPress Customizer (Additional CSS)
3. Created a functions.php file with inline CSS
4. Purged LiteSpeed Cache multiple times
5. Tried editing from the Block Editor

ADDITIONAL PROBLEM: When I try to save changes in the Block Editor (Appearance -> Editor), it shows "Review 1 change" but doesn't save. The save button doesn't work.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 SITE INFORMATION:

Domain: carmenalvarado.es
WordPress: 6.8.3
Theme: Twenty Twenty-Five (FSE block theme)
Active plugins:
  - LiteSpeed Cache 7.5.0.1
  - WPForms Lite 1.9.8.1
  - WP Mail SMTP 4.6.0
  - Hostinger Reach

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ WHAT I NEED:

Could you help me edit the footer template to show only the first column ("Carmen Alvarado" and "Cuidadora Profesional en Tarragona") and hide the other sections?

I would also like to know why the Block Editor is not saving changes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📸 SCREENSHOTS:

Attached screenshots showing:
1. Current footer with 4 columns
2. Error when trying to save in Block Editor

Thank you very much for your help.

Best regards,
Miguel
